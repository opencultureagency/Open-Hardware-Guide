# Open Hardware Guide

## Open Hardware
### Introduction

Open Hardware (OH) or “Open Source Hardware (OSHW) is a term for tangible artifacts — machines, devices, or other physical things — whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, distribute, and use those things.”[1]

The general benefits of open source methods and open tech innovation are:
Access to knowledge and product designs

Fast and distributed exchange of skills and knowledge

Accelerated innovation due to collaborative development

Low development costs and more expertise 

Easy adaptation and customization 

### What do you need for Open Tech?
**Tools & Materials:** 

Depends on the technology. Always try local sourcing first!

**License Example:**

A proper license for the product design.

For design-files, digital work:	cc-by-sa Creative Commons)[2]


For hardware, functionality:CERN OHL (Open Hardware License)[3]


**Open Source Software:** Linux and platform 

independent if possible

# #ASKotek
### Access to Skills and Knowledge – open tech emergency kit

Freely sharable and collaboration based Open Technologies are a form of Open Source that can also at as accelerators for peace and empowerment.

A versitile, robust and mobile trainer's kit with 40 items designed to tackle a range of basic education, innovation and self-training challenges #ASKotek enables "Access to skills & Development" in the field ... anywhere!

This basic Open Tech Kit provides tools and materials to learn and distribute knowledge and product development. 

### The set contains:
Basic electronics and connections
    
Soldering and cutting tools
    
Mechanical and measurement tools
   
A Linux computer and some adapters

Guidelines and additional things to get creative and start innovation on the spot


The kit can be used on site, in the field and can function as a startup tool-set for building a co-working space, learning hub or any other innovation community setup. 

It is designed to be modular, mobile and adaptable to any location or situation to share knowledge and empower innovation.

#ASKotek was created by the participants of the Let's Go jHUB project.

# Open Hardware Process -  Documentation Principals 

One key instrument of Open Hardware is clear documentation. In order to stay on track while developing or adapting a product, it is highly recommended to document the process to create an easy pattern to follow: Open Hardware Guide. This saves time and prototyping iterations. 

Therefore good sketches and pictures of the steps are needed, that trace the development process clearly and simply in the order that it happens. The following template might help as you take important notes along the way:

*Insert "Session 1" image*

**Steps:** Follow all working procedures & note the process 				step-by-step in the order it happens. Keep it clear 					and simple, note additional tips or details.

**Flops & Tops:**		What went wrong and should be avoided? 
				What went right and is noted as best practice?

**Open Questions:**	What challenges, problems still need to be solved?
				(**NB:** This section is key to make progress and help 				others to participate in the process and get on board 				the project)
